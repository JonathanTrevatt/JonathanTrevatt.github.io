Fits are determined by clearance and surface finish.
Clearance depends on the actual size of a parts.

- Sizes
  - Basic size – The exact theoretical size to which limits of deviation are assigned and are the same for both parts.
  - Actual size – The actual measured size of a particular finished part after machining.
  - Nominal Size – A general size value, close to the basic size, which is used for convenience. Usually a common fraction. E.g., a '5mm' shaft may have a basic size of 4.95mm.

- Limits of size – Limits for the actual size of a manufactured part
  - Upper limit - The largest allowable actual size for a part.
  - Lower limit - The minimum allowable actual size for a part.
- Deviation – The difference between the size of the part and the basic size.
  - Upper deviation – Upper limit minus basic size.
  - Lower deviation - Lower limit minus basic size.
  - Fundamental deviation - The upper or lower deviation - (whichever is smallest). I.e., the minimum deviation (best case scenario) from the basic size.
  A system of letters denote standard fundamental deviations (upper-case for holes, lower-case for shafts). The fundamental deviation of a part is specified by the letter that is closest to the actual fundamental deviation.
- Tolerance - A measure of precision. The difference between the upper and lower deviations from a basic size. The tolerance tends to be a function of basic size.
- International tolerance grade (IT) ISO standard – Specifies groups of tolerances which have the same accuracy (accounting for differences due to basic size). Ranges from IT01, IT0, IT1, ..., IT16 (total 18 grades).
- (Overall) Tolerance grade / tolerance zone - The fundamental deviation and the IT grade, presented together to specify the tolerance and deviation of a part. E.g., "H9".

- Clearance - The difference between the actual sizes of manufactured mating parts. E.g., the actual size of a hole minus the actual size of a shaft.
- Interferance - Negative clearance. The difference between the actual sizes of mating parts, when the sizes of those parts would overlap without gap between them.
- Allowance - The theoretical minimum clearance (or maximum interference) between mating parts. I.e., the tightest possible fit between two mating parts, considering their tolerances.

- Basis
  - Hole basis - The system of fits where the basic size refers to the minimum hole size. I.e., the fundamental deviation of the hole is 0.
  - Shaft basis - The system of fits where the basic size refers to the maximum shaft size. I.e., the fundamental deviation of the shaft is 0.

- Fit - The degree of tightness between mating parts, specified by the tolerance grade of each part, and organised into descriptive classes (depending on use of ISO or ANSI standards), and further organised into 3 broad descriptive categories.
  - **Clearance fit** - Mating parts will always leave a space or clearance when assembled. There will always be a minimum clearance (allowance), i.e., the shaft will always be smaller than the hole.
  - **Transition fit** - Mating parts will sometimes be an interference fit and sometimes be a clearance fit when assembled. The loosest fit is the difference between the smallest shaft and the largest hole. The tightest fit is the difference between the largest shaft and the smallest hole.
  - **Interference fit** - Mating parts will always interfere when assembled. The shaft will always be larger than the hole. To assemble the parts under this condition, it would be necessary to stretch the hole or shrink the shaft or to use force to press the shaft into the hole. This kind of fit can be used to fasten two parts together without the use of mechanical fasteners or adhesive.
  - **Metric/ISO standard fits** - Categorises fits into one of 8 numbered fit classes with corresponding descriptive names, for use with either the basic hole or basic shaft system.
    - ![Fit classes|700](image/Clearances/1718926394374.png)
  - **English/ANSI standard fits** - Categorises fits into on of 5 descriptive classes using the basic hole system.
    - ![fits description|700](image/Clearances/1718927426916.png)
    - RC - Running clearance / running sliding / loose running fit.
    The loosest of the fit classes. A shaft moves freely and positioning is not critical.
    - LC - Locating clearance fit.
    Tighter than the RC class fits. Shaft and hole may be the same size (line-to-line fit). Shaft is located more accurately, but it may still be loose.
    - LT - Locating transition fit – a transition between LC an LN fits.
    - LN - Locating interference fit – Shaft can be line to line, but is almost always larger than the hole. Used where a part must be positively located relative to another part.
    - FN - Force interference (and shrink) fit – Pure interference fit. Shaft is always larger than hole. Used to transmit torque, secure a bearing or pulley to a shaft, or anchor otherwise sliding parts, even if under load.

### Fits with vase-mode bushings

Vase-mode prints a single external wall in a spiral pattern (no layer divisions). To get a D=10mm internal hole, you must model D=10mm+(2*layerwidth). Any clearance is then added on top of that in the model. The following fits apply for a 10mm pin (printed as normal), and a spiralised sleave with designed clearances (i.e., shaft basis).

Nominal diam (mm) | Basic diam (mm) | clearance (mm) | fit
-----
10 | 10 | 0 | Friction fit - Stretches bushing slightly. Static joint not intended to come apart.
10 | 10.1 | 0.1 | Snug fit - Static joint intended to occasionally come apart.
10 | 10.2 | 0.2 | Tight running fit - Pin joint with little slop. Recommend using lubricant.
10 | 10.3 | 0.3 | Loose running fit - Pin joint with slop. Spins more freely.
