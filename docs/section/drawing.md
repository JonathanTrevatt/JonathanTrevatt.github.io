- Isolate component in assembly, then right click -> new drawing -> visible only.

- Section view, hold shift to break alignment link.
- Section view, you probably want slice option
- Apply CenterPoint to circular holes
- Dimension critical dimensions
- Use dimension break tool when necessary to reduce confusion
- Use text with arrows to add notes on particular features (e.g. debur this edge)
