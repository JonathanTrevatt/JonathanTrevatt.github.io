## Blacksmithing

***Cleaver:***

- To create the cleaver, I used a cut-off from an old leaf spring from a car. 
- I repeatedly brought the metal to "cherry hot" in a forge and hammered it into shape - applying a taper towards the edge, creating a curve, and strightening the blade.
- With the metal hot, I punched a hole near the front of the spine to allow the cleaver to be hung up.
- I performed a heat treatment called annealing, where the piece is held at about 900°C for long enough to allow recrystalisation into austenite, then cooled very slowly (~20°C/hr) to transform it into course pealite, which is soft and ductile. This makes it soft enough to easily machine.
- The metal now softened, I drilled out holes in the tang for securing the handle, and used a belt sander and file to refine the shape and taper. 
- I then performed more heat treatments: quenching (very fast cooling in water) to form martensite, which is very hard and strong (but brittle), then tempering to make it tougher and less brittle.
- The surface of the cleaver was peened with a hammer to again increase the hardness (and provide some character to the piece), but just on the surface.
- I secured some well seasoned Australian Ironbark wood to the tang using bolt through the drilled holes and used the belt sander to rough out the shape of the handle.
- After replacing the bolts with cut brass rods, I peened the surfaces to roll them over and secure the handles. Then the shape of the handles was further refined.
- The remaining steps to complete will be to treat the handle with oil, apply my makers mark (likely with electrolysis), clean the blade, and grind in the final edge profile.

***Crowbar: (Picture coming soon)***

- Created from a strip of steel sheet.
- I cut a nail pulling groove in the hot metal using a hammer and blacksmithing chisel.
- I curled one end of the sheet into a circular section with an appropriate size and length for a handle of a hand tool, with the intention that it can be extended with a pipe for more leverage as needed.
- I hammered in the curve for the crowbar.
- I applied a heat treatment to make it strong and springy.
- I possible improvement could be to use a torch to heat and selectively quench just the edge to make it harder. This is a selective heat treatment method similar to that used to create chisels.

## Leather smithing

I spent some time involved in a LARP (live action role play) group. During this time, I learned how to do some leather work and I crafted a set of tree-themed armour.

## Signature Seal
I first created a design for a wax seal, and got that manufactured.

	<img src="projects/other/_media/wax_seal.png" alt="Wax Seal" width="150" height="150">
</div>

Later, after I started blacksmithing, I realised that the features of the wax seal design might be too fine for a makers mark. So I made a more robust design for that use.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; justify-content: center;">

This is designed to have the black parts act as a mask for a chemical etching process.

### The Coming Comet

## Flag creation
I wanted to create a design for a more unified and inclusive flag for all Australians, and I thought this design looked much cooler than our current design.
The red and black on the right, and the yellow circle are elements from the aboriginal flag. The red is the red earth, the black is the sky, and the yellow circle is the sun.
In this flag, the specific colour of the yellow should be gold #FFCD00 (one of Australia's national colours, representing the golden wattle, Australia's national flower).
There are elements of the current flag as well. The southern cross is present, and the commonwealth star represents the federation of the six Australian states, and the territories.
You may notice elements of each flag "leaking" into each other. The sun partially covers the left, and the stars are on the right. This was to represent the joining of cultures to create something awesome.
It follows the principles of good flag design:
- Meaningful symbolism
- limited colour palettes
- No lettering or seals
- Distinctiveness
- Simplicity 
	- Can be drawn from memory by a child
	- Shapes can be recreated precisely using only geometric scribing tools (compass and ruler)
- Clear lines, no gradients

> Note: This design is not presented here as an appropriate flag to replace the current Australian flag, but rather, just because I personally find it to be aesthetically pleasing. I think that any suitable new flag should not feature the union jack - instead emphasising Australia's unique identity.
